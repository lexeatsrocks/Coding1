Enemies that can be pushed and respawn
  -Enemies are made from actor blueprint. To make them spawn and respawn, there is a spawner and a spawner manager. When enemies are defeated, the manager checks how many enemies
  there currently are and decides if they need respawned or not yet. When an enemy is touched by the player, simulate physics is activated, allowing the 
    enemies to become basically ragdolls and they are "eliminated" and despawn. 
Falling Platforms that change colors 
  -Not one hundred percent sure on how to explain this one, but I will do my best. 
  Falling platforms run on multiple custom commands that can be activated by the player. When a player steps on a falling platform, the color changes to show that
  it has been activated. Then, it follows a timeline animation to show them falling and returning to their original positions with different colors coordinated to 
  the respective part of the cycle. 
Moving Platforms
  -Moving platforms, similar to falling platforms, also use a timeline to move. However, unlike falling platforms, they are not directly linked to the players actions
  and follow a particular course.
Mana Potion
  - The mana potion is an item that the player is able to pick up and use or drop. Essentially, when the player picks one up, a print string appears letting them 
  know they have the item. If they use it, another print string is activated to show the player that they gained mana. However, the player is unable to have
  multiple items in their possession at once and will be unable to pick up another until they use or drop the one they have. 
Health Potion
- The health potion works the same way as the mana potion, but the print string and material is different to show the distinction between the two.
