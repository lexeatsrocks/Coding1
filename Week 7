Added Changes for Week 7
Killing floor
- Added a cube that can kill the player. It triggers the you died screen and forces the player back to their checkpoint. 
  Honestly not entirely sure how I got that one working. 
Save Checkpoint/Load Checkpoint
- Cylinders that act as checkpoints are around the map. By stepping on them, it changes the player's spawn. When a player dies, they are placed back at their last 
  check point. 
Main menu
- Another level was made and a camera actor was placed to show a single shot. With the added widgets for a start game
  and quit game button, it allows the player to either quit program or enter the level. 
You Died Widget
- The widget activates when the player touches the killing floor.
  It uses delays and camera fades to transition the character back to their save point. 
  It is anchored to the middle of the screen and using delays, appears and disapears when the player has
  teleported back to save point. 
Name of game in corner of screen widget
- Widget that shows the name of game and my name. It was made using a canvas and text and anchored to the bottom right 
  of the screen.
